# Datatables

This is a simple demonstration of [datatables.js](http://datatables.net/) and how to use server-side paging.
It creates a single table in the development Postgres instance called "zips". The zipcode data is populated
by the zip_codes.csv file in the priv/repo directory. See seeds.exs for the code that is used to populate it.

To run the demonstration :

      git clone https://github.com/fmcgeough/datatables
      cd datatables
      mix deps.get
      mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate
      npm install
      mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs
      mix phoenix.server

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000/zips`](http://localhost:4000/zips) from your browser to see the
page that uses datatables.
